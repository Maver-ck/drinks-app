# Drinks App

This is a simple drinks app which uses the REST api events data to show cards with details of the events.

The cards show the title, user posting the event, the time it was posted as period in the past and the location. Clicking on the location will open google maps with the coordinates.

A picture of the event type is shown also.  There is a comments section at the bottom of each card which can be clicked to display comments.

- I chose JS instead of TS due to time constraints of setting up a project in TS and I also have more recent experience setting up new React projects with JS rather than TS (although I predominantly work with an existing TS React project). 

- There are a few styling issues which I would have fixed if I had time, such as the tiny drinks logo in the header and the colour of the text in the card which I wanted to be brown as in the colour palette. The CSS framework I was using (semantic ui) was overriding some of my colours I think so I would need to override those. 

- I would tried to add functionality to add comments if I had the time. 

- I would have ensured the cards didn't all resize on a single row also. 

- I would also have added some Jest tests for each component if I had the time. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
